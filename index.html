I do my best to try and keep you happy about us being apart for these weeks. And it's hard. I really hate being away from you. It takes a lot of concentration for me to try and actually be with other people instead of thinking about you. It's really crazy for me. I never knew what it was really like to be in love, and I never knew you could love someone as much as this. It's hard trying to be optimistic about things when we've been apart so much for so long. I want to be with you forever, and don't want to have to go through this again. But I know that we will, and it's painful to think about. I feel like us being apart for so long has brought us closer together. It's made us realize how much we need each other. </h4>
